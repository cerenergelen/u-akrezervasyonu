# FLIGHT RESERVATION
I created a class to allow user information to be entered, and to enable access to the information within this class by other classes within the application, I created an internal class named User.
class User : class Base,This statement specifies that the User class will inherit properties from another class called Base, and the User class can access all the public properties and behaviors of the Base class.
